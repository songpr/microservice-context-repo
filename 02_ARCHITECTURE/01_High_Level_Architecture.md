## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Cloud-Native Design
- **Microservices Architecture**: Loosely coupled services with well-defined APIs
- **Container-First**: All services designed for container deployment
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication using event streaming
- **API-First**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specifications

### 2. Hybrid Cloud Strategy
- **Best-of-Breed**: Leverage optimal services from both Azure and AWS
- **Data Sovereignty**: Maintain data residency requirements
- **Vendor Flexibility**: Avoid single-cloud vendor lock-in
