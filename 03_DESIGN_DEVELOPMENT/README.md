## Using the Templates

### For AI (GitHub Copilot) Interaction
1. **Copy Template Context**: Use template content as context for AI prompts
2. **Use Structured Prompts**: Follow the AI-optimized prompt templates
3. **Specify Role**: Clearly indicate your role when requesting assistance
4. **Include Examples**: Reference template examples in your requests

**Example AI Prompt:**
```markdown
@copilot I need to create a user journey map for the customer service portal.

Context from UX_Design template:
- User persona: Frustrated customer needing quick support
- Starting point: Support portal landing page
- End goal: Issue resolved with minimal effort
- Pain points: Complex navigation, long wait times

Please generate a comprehensive user journey map following UX best practices.
```

### For Human Users
1. **Select Appropriate Template**: Choose based on your role and task
2. **Follow Process Guidelines**: Use the step-by-step instructions
3. **Customize for Project**: Adapt templates to your specific needs
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link to related templates and documents

### Integration with Development Workflow
- **Planning Phase**: Use Function Design and Solution Architecture templates
- **Design Phase**: Apply UX Design and Technical Design templates
- **Implementation**: Follow Coding and Security templates
- **Testing Phase**: Utilize Testing templates
- **Deployment**: Apply CI/CD templates
