# Enterprise Customer Experience Solution

Repository for context-aware development supporting both AI and Human collaboration to build microservices for enterprise customer experience solutions.

## Overview

This repository contains the complete documentation and implementation for an enterprise customer experience (CX) solution built on Azure and AWS cloud platforms. The solution includes:

- Modern contact center implementation
- AI-powered virtual assistants
- Customer data platform (CDP) integration
- Omnichannel communication services

## GitHub Copilot Enterprise Integration

This repository is optimized for GitHub Copilot Enterprise with:

- **AI-First Development**: Comprehensive prompts and templates in `.github/prompts/`
- **Detailed Instructions**: Complete coding guidelines in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Context-Aware Structure**: Organized for maximum AI understanding and code generation
- **Productivity Tracking**: Mandatory AI usage logging and analysis

## AI Usage Logging System

### Requirements

**Every AI prompt interaction must be logged** in weekly log files in the `logs/` directory with:
- Timestamp and session details
- Prompt content and context files
- AI engine used (GitHub Copilot, Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- Time savings and productivity metrics
- Token usage and cost analysis
- Quality assessment and learning notes

### Quick Start

1. Create or use current week's log file: `logs/AI_USAGE_LOG_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Follow the log format in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
3. Log every AI interaction immediately after completion
4. Use the analysis scripts to generate reports:

```bash
# Create new weekly log
./scripts/create_weekly_log.sh

# Analyze current week
./scripts/analyze_ai_usage.sh

# Generate weekly report
./scripts/analyze_ai_usage.sh weekly

# Analyze specific week
./scripts/analyze_ai_usage.sh weekly 2025-07-03
```
