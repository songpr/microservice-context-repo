## Services

### Customer Service
- **Purpose**: Customer profile management and CRM integration
- **Technology**: .NET Core/Java Spring Boot/Node.js
- **Responsibilities**: Customer data, preferences, service history

### Order Service

### API Gateway
- **Purpose**: Request routing and API management
- **Technology**: AWS API Gateway/Azure API Management/Kong
- **Responsibilities**: Routing, rate limiting, authentication, monitoring

## Development Guidelines

1. **Microservices Pattern**: Each service should be independently deployable
2. **API Design**: Follow RESTful API design principles
3. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling and logging
4. **Security**: Use proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
5. **Monitoring**: Include health checks and telemetry

## Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: HTTP/REST for real-time operations
- **Asynchronous**: Message queues for event-driven operations
- **Service Discovery**: Use service registry for dynamic service location

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Service-level business logic testing
- **Integration Tests**: Service-to-service communication testing
- **Contract Tests**: API contract validation
- **Load Tests**: Performance and scalability testing

## Deployment

- **Containerization**: Docker containers for consistent deployment
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes/Docker Swarm for container orchestration
- **CI/CD**: Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
